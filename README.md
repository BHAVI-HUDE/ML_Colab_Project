# ML Colab Project — Iris Classification

This repository is a demo ML project built for Google Colab.  
It classifies iris flowers into three species using a Random Forest model.

## Structure

- `notebooks/iris_classification.ipynb` — the primary Colab notebook  
- `models/iris_rf_model.joblib` — saved trained model  
- `results/results.json` — saved evaluation results  
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies  
- `.gitignore` — files to ignore such as model and results  

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
2. Run all cells (ensuring environment is installed)  
3. Check results, visualizations  
4. Save & share the notebook link
